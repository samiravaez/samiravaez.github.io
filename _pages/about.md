I am currently a PhD student in <a href="https://drexel.edu/cci/academics/information-science-department/" target="_blank">Information Science</a> at Drexel University, where I work under the supervision of Dr. Michael Ekstrand at the <a href="https://inertial.science" target="_blank">INERTIAL Lab</a>. My research focuses on studying and evaluating information access systems, particularly recommender systems, to ensure they are used effectively and equitably for the benefit of the diverse stakeholders involved.   
Before joining Drexel, I earned my MSc in <a href="https://en.ce.kntu.ac.ir/" target="_blank">Computer Engineering</a> (AI specialization) from <a href="https://en.kntu.ac.ir/" target="_blank">K. N. Toosi University of Technology</a>. During my time there, I studied bias in ranking and recommendation at the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kntu-tis" target="_blank">Textual Intelligent Systems Lab</a>.

**Iâ€™m always open to collaboration, discussion, or just sharing ideas. Feel free to get in touch!**
